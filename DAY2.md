# Day 2 - AI Voice Agent Challenge 🎙️

**Date:** November 23, 2025

## 🎯 Today's Focus
Deep dive into backend development and LiveKit integration for the AI voice agent project.

## ✅ Key Accomplishments

### 1. Backend Development
- Built a robust backend system for the voice-agents project
- Implemented Python-based agent architecture
- Set up asyncio-based asynchronous processing for real-time voice handling

### 2. LiveKit Integration
- Successfully configured LiveKit server for voice streaming
- Implemented LiveKit CLI tools for agent management
- Set up real-time communication protocols
- Debugged and resolved LiveKit runtime errors

### 3. Technical Challenges Solved
- Resolved asyncio/LiveKit runtime errors
- Fixed 'program not found' spawn errors in PowerShell
- Debugged agent.py execution issues
- Handled npm-related errors during development

### 4. Project Setup
- Created livekit-server directory structure
- Configured development environment in VS Code
- Set up Python virtual environment with required dependencies
- Installed and configured the 'uv' package manager for Python 3.9

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Python 3.9+
- **Voice Processing:** LiveKit
- **Development Environment:** VS Code, PowerShell
- **Package Management:** uv, npm
- **Async Framework:** asyncio

## 📚 What I Learned
